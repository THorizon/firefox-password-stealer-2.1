# firefox-password-stealer-2.1
Firefox Password Stealer 2.1 is an updated version that steals a specific password from Firefox Lockwise on Windows 10.
It copies the password and saves it inside of a text document on a USB stick/drive that you can specify.

I personally use this script on my Malduino but it works on other BadUSB sticks as well.
P.S. The previous version of the Firefox Passsword Stealer no longer works.
It currently works on Firefox version 87.0
